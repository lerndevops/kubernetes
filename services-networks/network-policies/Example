By Default , all pods in the cluster can communicate with any other pod and reach out to any available IP.

Network Policies allow you to limit what network traffic is allowed to and from pods in your cluster.

wget -O canal.yaml https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.5/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/canal/canal.yaml (If flannel is already there)

kubectl apply -f canal.yaml

1. Create nginx pod

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: network-policy-secure-pod
  labels:
    app: secure-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80


2. Create a test pod

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: network-policy-client-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: radial/busyboxplus:curl
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do sleep 3600; done"]


Use this command to get the  IP address of the Nginx pod:
kubectl get pod network-policy-secure-pod -o wide
Use the secure pod's IP address to test network access from the client pod to the secure Nginx pod:
kubectl exec network-policy-client-pod -- curl <secure pod cluster ip address>



NOW…….

Create a network policy that restricts all access to the secure pod, except to and from pods which bear the allow-access: "true" label:



apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: my-network-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: secure-app
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          allow-access: "true"
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          allow-access: "true"
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80


kubectl get networkpolicies
kubectl describe networkpolicy my-network-policy


Now

kubectl exec network-policy-client-pod -- curl 10.244.2.2 

This will be timeout as the client pod doesn’t have the label that we put in policy allow-access=true.

Now update the client pod with label , it works again !!
