Backing up your cluster can be a useful exercise, especially if you have a single etcd cluster, as all the cluster state is stored there. The etcdctl utility allows us to easily create a snapshot of our cluster state (etcd) and save this to an external location. In this lesson, we’ll go through creating the snapshot and talk about restoring in the event of failure.


Get the etcd binaries:
wget https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/download/v3.3.12/etcd-v3.3.12-linux-amd64.tar.gz

Unzip the compressed binaries:
tar xvf etcd-v3.3.12-linux-amd64.tar.gz

Move the files into /usr/local/bin:
sudo mv etcd-v3.3.12-linux-amd64/etcd* /usr/local/bin

Take a snapshot of the etcd datastore using etcdctl:
sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save snapshot.db --cacert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt --cert /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --key /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.key

View the help page for etcdctl:
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --help

Browse to the folder that contains the certificate files:
ls /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/
cd

View that the snapshot was successful:
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --write-out=table snapshot status snapshot.db

Zip up the contents of the etcd directory:
sudo tar -zcvf etcd.tar.gz /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd

Copy the etcd directory to another server:
